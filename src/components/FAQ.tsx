  {
    q: "How is your pricing structured?",
    a: "Fixed monthly retainer based on service scope. No percentage of ad spend, no hidden costs. Plans start at ₹8,000 ($200) for a single landing page, ₹20,000 onwards ($400+) per month for Meta Ads + Web, and ₹25,000 onwards ($500+) per month for full Omnichannel scaling. Custom Enterprise plans available on request.",
  },
  {
    q: "What results can I realistically expect?",
    a: "Results depend on your product, market, and starting point. We focus on measurable KPIs from day one — ROAS, CPA, conversion rates. We set clear benchmarks in Week 1 and track progress weekly with full transparency.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to see results?",
    a: "Quick wins (audience refinement, creative optimization) appear within 2-4 weeks. Meaningful improvements in ROAS and CPA typically show by week 8-12 as we gather enough data to optimize effectively.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you guarantee results?",
    a: "We guarantee effort, transparency, and a structured process. We can't guarantee specific numbers (anyone who does is lying), but we commit to data-driven optimization and weekly reporting so you always know where things stand.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you work with businesses outside India?",
    a: "Yes. We're India-based but work with clients globally. We understand regional nuances in targeting, creative, and compliance across markets.",
  },
  {
    q: "What platforms do you advertise on?",
    a: "We specialize in Meta (Facebook & Instagram) and Google (Search, Display, YouTube, Shopping). We can also manage LinkedIn ads for B2B use cases.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why not percentage of ad spend?",
    a: "Percentage-based pricing creates a conflict of interest — the agency earns more by spending more, not by performing better. Our fixed retainer aligns us with your goal: maximum ROI, not maximum spend.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I want to pause?",
    a: "No long-term contracts required. We work on a month-to-month basis. You stay because of results, not lock-ins.",
